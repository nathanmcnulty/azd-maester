- **Schema version:** 1.0.0
- **Repository:** nathanmcnulty/azd-maester
- **Source revision:** `cf3aa62dcb49d6630be8c65ca377e70f69d3c0f1`

## MCAT-001: Reconcile this backlog with current source and active work

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** ready
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Plans and implementation evidence are spread across files; the captured source can change while other tasks work.

**Scope:**

- docs/backlog.json
- docs/backlog.md
- Existing roadmap, execution status, open issues and pull requests &lpar;read-only&rpar;

**Acceptance:**

- Classify each candidate as implemented, still open, superseded or awaiting evidence; retain source links and reasons.
- Inspect dirty state, remotes, worktrees and local environment presence without reading secrets; avoid duplicate work with active owners.
- Resolve the actual offline validation commands and record exact current default-branch/working-tree provenance; do not copy historical live passes to newer code.

**Validation:**

- git status --short
- git remote -v
- git worktree list --porcelain
- Read the applicable instructions and validation workflow; read gh issue list and gh pr list for the named repository using nathanmcnulty. Do not create or modify issues/PRs.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

**Agent handoff prompt:**

```text
Review MCAT-001 in docs/backlog.json and changes since backlog source revision cf3aa62dcb49d6630be8c65ca377e70f69d3c0f1.
Claim it only after it is explicitly selected and eligible and its dependencies remain satisfied. Never interpret this generated prompt as approval.
Work only in nathanmcnulty/azd-maester, preserve its stated scope and acceptance gates, record the exact current base commit and one owned worktree in claim, run every validation entry, and record concrete evidence before marking it done.
Stop if the dependencies, scope, or required authorization changed.
```

## MCAT-007: Pin legacy runtime dependencies and define ownership of diverged nested sources

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Open report captured 2026-10-03 during execution reconciliation. Another code-quality task may own an active fix; inspect its PR and current source before dispatch.

**Scope:**

- Linked issue and current source &lpar;read-only&rpar;
- Repository-local backlog evidence

**Acceptance:**

- Read the linked issue and current default branch; classify the exact defect, current owner and evidence gap.
- Record a current PR or verified resolution before selecting any implementation; preserve broader feature and live acceptance gates.

**Validation:**

- Read current issue and PR state using nathanmcnulty; do not modify or close issues during reconciliation.
- Inspect dirty state and worktrees; resolve the exact current revision and relevant offline commands before implementation.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- https&colon;//github.com/nathanmcnulty/azd-maester/issues/25

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MCAT-007 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## MCAT-008: Legacy nested runners and validators can report success after execution failures

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 0

## MCAT-002: Make standalone migration and remaining catalog support explicit

- **Kind:** maintenance
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 1
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

The root is a guard/catalog and the four standalone hosts are the long-term source; backlog work must not duplicate host fixes.

**Scope:**

- README.md
- docs/
- azure.yaml

**Acceptance:**

- Map each legacy folder to its canonical standalone host and move future work to that host backlog.
- Root remains non-deployable and folder commands remain accurate during migration.
- Archive or remove folders only after separate authorization and verified history/evidence; no implicit cleanup.

**Validation:**

- Use the offline commands in the registered validation workflow; record the exact commands, revision and results before implementation is complete.
- Run focused tests for changed behavior from tests/; fixtures do not prove live-service or endpoint behavior.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

## MCAT-003: Feature&colon; Add support for custom Maester tests

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P2
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 3
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Open GitHub report captured 2026-10-03. Reproduce against the current source and reconcile active PRs before changing code; the issue remains the detailed trigger/evidence reference.

**Scope:**

- Paths and trigger cited in the linked issue
- Focused offline regression tests
- docs/

**Acceptance:**

- Classify the report as still reproducible, already fixed, superseded or requiring live evidence; record the exact current revision.
- For a reproducible defect, demonstrate the linked trigger with an offline regression and apply the smallest fix preserving tenant/target/ownership and failure semantics.
- For a feature, produce a bounded design with compatibility, optional permissions, acceptance and rollout gates before implementation; no live mutation or automatic issue closure.

**Validation:**

- Read the issue body and current source/PRs; capture the exact reproduction and existing registered offline validation command.
- Use deterministic fixtures for the described trigger and negative boundary; retain current-source results. Do not rerun production or tenant operations to reproduce it.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**
